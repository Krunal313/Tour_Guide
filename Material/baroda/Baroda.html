                    <h3>
                        Vadodara is situated on the banks of the river Vishwamitri (whose name is derived from the great saint Rishi Vishwamitra)</h3>
                    <p> The city was once called Chandravati, after its ruler Raja Chandan, then Viravati, the abode of the brave, and then Vadpatra because of the abundance of banyan trees on the banks of the Vishwamitri. From Vadpatra it derived its present
                        name Baroda or Vadodara. The greatest period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of Maharaja Sayajirao III in 1875. It was an era of great progress and constructive achievements in all fields. </p>

                    <p>It was he who visualised a general scheme of development in all branches of knowledge at different stages, with the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda at the apex. Modern Vadodara owes its beauty, its educational institutions
                        and its masterpieces of architecture to the insight and vision of this great ruler.</p>
