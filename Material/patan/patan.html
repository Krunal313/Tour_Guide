					<h3>Patan was established by the Chavda ruler Vanaraja in the ninth century as "Anahilapataka".
					During 10th-13th century, the city served as the capital of the Chaulukya dynasty, who succeeded the Chavdas.</h3>
					<p>It is a historical place located on the bank of the now extinct Saraswati River.which is probably what remains of the ancient Sarasvati River. 
						Patan has an old market which is quite sizeable and is believed to have been in continuous operation since at least the rule of Vaghelas.</p>
					
						 <p>Patan is home to the Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University named after the famous polymath Acharya Hemachandra. 
							It was previously known as North Gujarat University.</p>

					<p> The patola sari is one of the finest hand-woven sarees produced today. This is a specialty of Patan. It is famous for extremely delicate patterns woven with great precision and clarity. 
						A patola sari takes 4 to 6 months to make, depending on how complicated the designs is and if the length is 5 or 6 metres.</p>
