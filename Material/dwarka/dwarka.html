					<h3>Dwarka means 'Gateway to Heaven' in Sanskrit. Dwarka in the ancient times was known as Anarta which has been Lord Krishna's terrestrial empire.</h3>
					<p>Dwarka have been the first capital of Gujarat. It is mentioned in the Mahabharata,
                         one of the two great epics of ancient India, as well as the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Skand Purana, Vishnu Purana and the Harivamsha.</p>
					
						 <p>This city is regarded as one of the most prominent Chardham,
                              and one of the seven most ancient religious sites in the country.</p>

					<p>According to Hindu mythology, Dvārakā was a city where Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu, once lived.
                         It is believed that Krishna was born in Mathura, just south of Delhi in the modern state of Uttar Pradesh.
                          His uncle, Kansa, was the tyrannical ruler of this city and was eventually killed by Krishna. Kansa’s father-in-law, who was Jarasandh,
                           the king of Magadha, was furious when he heard of Kansa’s murder, and tried to avenge his death.

                        Although Mathura was attacked 17 times, it did not fall to Jarasandh. Nevertheless,
                         his clan, the Yadavs, suffered heavy losses over the course of the lengthy conflict.
                          As Krishna realized that his people would not be able to withstand another war with Jarasandh,
                           he decided to leave Mathura with the Yadavs.</p>

						<p>Today, Mehsana is a separate district of this state and is steering fast on the path of industrialization 
							and development.
