					<h3> Kutch is the largest district of India and about 2 million people live there. 
                        The Kutch district is home to the Kutchi people who speak the Kutchi language. </h3>
					<p>The history of Kachchh can be divided into two periods the ancient and modern or the period starting from 14th Century of
                         Jadeja dynasty and the period thereafter. When the Sama Rajput rulers of Sindh won the Kachchh region, a separate state
                          of Kachchh came into existence during 14th century. 
                        In ancient Hindu writings, this region is referred as land on sea-shore or desert area.</p>
					
						 <p>The Rann is known for its marshy salt flats which become snow white after the shallow 
                            water dries up each season before the monsoon rains.</p>

					<p>Kutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in the west and the 
                        Gulf of Kutch in south and southeast. The northern and eastern parts are surrounded by 
                        the Great and Little Rann (seasonal wetlands) of Kutch. When there were not many dams built on its rivers,
                         the Rann of Kutch remained wetlands for a large part of the year. Even today, 
                         the region remains wet for a significant part of year. the district is well connected by road,
                          rail and air. There are four airports in the district: Naliya, Kandla, Mundra, and Bhuj.
                           Bhuj is well connected with Mumbai airport. Being a border district, Kutch has both an 
                           army and an air force base.</p>

						<p>The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the Sir Creek. 
                            The Kutch peninsula is an example of active fold and thrust tectonism. 
                            In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized
                             by fault propagation folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently
                              dipping southern limbs. The epicenter of the very destructive 2001 
                              earthquake was in the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault.</p>
