					<h3>One of the 12 holy Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva is in Jyotirlinga here in Somnath. Somnath is also mentioned in Rigveda. </h3>
					<p>It’s said that Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple in Somnath, made of gold; this was rebuilt by Ravana in silver, 
                        by Krishna in wood and by Bhimdev in stone.The current serene, symmetrical structure was built to traditional designs on the original coastal site:
                         it’s painted a creamy colour and boasts a little fine sculpture. The large,
                         black Shiva lingam at its heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as jyotirlinga.</p>
					
						 <p>The ancient temple’s timeline can be traced from 649 BC but is believed to be older than that.
                             The present form was reconstructed in 1951.</p>

					<p>Somnath’s first temple is said to have existed 2000 years ago. Is. In 649 AD, 
                        King Maitre of Vallabhini built a second temple in place of the temple and renovated it.
                         In 725, the old ruler of Sindh took his army and attacked the temple and destroyed the temple.
                          Pratishtha King Nag Bhatt II constructed the temple for the third time in 815 using
                           a red stone (sandstone) stone. In 1026, Mahmud Ghazni lent the precious jewels and property of Somnath temple.
                            After looting, slaughtering innumerable pilgrims of the temple and burning the temple and destroying it.
                             During 1026-1042 Solanki Raja Bhimdev built the fourth temple of Bhoj and Anhilwad Patan, Parmar King of Malwa.
                             Somnath was destroyed when Delhi Sultanate occupied Gujarat in 1299. In 1394 it was destroyed again. In 1706,
                              Mughal ruler Aurangzeb again demolished the temple.</p>
